# 3DEngine

-= Objective =-
This application renders 3D objects with spherical meshes, simple physics interactions, and lighting from different color sources.
It was originally created as a final project for my Advanced Java Programming class, but it has evolved into my pet project for learning the ins and outs of graphics programming, game design, and physics simulation.

It doesn't run on the GPU because I opted to not use OpenGL, as I wanted to do everything from scratch. I use no outside libraries or frameworks (except for the basic Math, Application, and ArrayList functionality). Every class is written by me alone including Vector, Line, Triangle, Mesh, Object, Physics, Lighting, Graphics Pipeline, EventManager, Timer, Transformation Matrixes, and even Color.
